### git branch (-m | -M) \[\<oldbranch\>\] \<newbranch\>

`<oldbranch`> will be renamed to `<newbranch`>

git default branch name is `master`

```bash
cd to-your-dir
git init
git add *
git commit -m "message"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin your-repo-addr
git push origin main
```

### .git

This file is created by `git init`

### git init

### origin

origin
```

### Changes not staged for comit

### git push

```bash
git push <remote> <branch>
```

### git pull

`git pull <remote repo> <branch>`  
incoporate changes from a remote repo into the current branch.

1. git init
2. git remote add origin \<url\> # set remote repo with this url

### clone vs pull

pull sets remote repo automatically  
copy + merge

### git clone
