### 1. Look at the big picture

- Frame the problem  
  -\. know the business objective  

> **a data *pipeline***: a sequence of data processing components

- Select a performance measure
  - RMSE(the Root Mean Square Error)
    - generally preferred performance measure for regression tasks
$$
    RMSE(X,h) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}{(h(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})}}}
$$
